  Design patterns are a part of our everyday life. Whenever there is a common problem, there is already a solution to said problem. The same goes for any software related issues, there is a template that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns also allow individuals with little experience to fix problems thanks to the trial and error of previous users. 
  
  Some design patterns I used over the course of this class are reactive data design pattern and singleton design pattern. An example of my use of reactive data is when code is re-run whenever a collection is updated. An example of my use of singleton is when my code is able to access a newly created class.  
  
  To conclude, design patterns have allowed me to save time on coding that wouldâ€™ve normally taken me a long time to figure out on my own. And while figuring something out has the benefit of learning how it works, spending too much time on a singular problem when there are others to be solved make design patterns beneficial.
