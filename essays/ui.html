<p>With the introduction of HTML and CSS, I was very eager to learn how to build a webpage. So much so that I though it would be very easy but tedious to do so. However, the further I got into HTML and CSS, the more I realized this was going to me a tedious and difficult road ahead.</p>

<p>Look at a webpage, it doesn’t look like they should be much coding in it but behind the scenes there’s a lot going on. Having to make sure both my HTML and my CSS files work both working correctly took a lot as I would have simple looking but hard to fix errors such as font colors and fonts not displaying properly when loading up my webpage. The introduction of Bootstrap 5 made it easier for me to make my webpages look nicer as it now has its own CSS style sheet to use rather than having to create my own. Loading up icons as well as making margins were much easier with Bootstrap 5.</p>

<p>To conclude, making a webpage is way harder that it seems. To have such a nice and eye-catching webpage takes a lot of careful coding as the simplest mistake can make all the difference from having all your icons being spaced out correctly to having them be bullet points across your whole webpage. I plan to continue learning more about HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5 as I see myself wanting to get a job related to webpage design in the future.</p>
