  Over the course of my time in ICS 314, I learned a great deal regarding software engineering. From getting used to GitHub to learning how to create a website, the things I have learned in this class will definitely help me in my life as a computer engineer. Two concepts that stood out to me during the course of this semester were design patterns and ethics in software engineering.

  Design patterns have helped me during ICS 314 my being able to learn from the solutions of previous individuals who have had the same issues I have had while coding. Ethics in software engineering has taught me what the rights and wrongs of software engineering are. These concepts can help me beyond software engineering by learning from the mistakes of previous individuals as well ass thinking ahead before doing something so that it doesnâ€™t negatively effects those around me as well as myself. 

  To conclude, what I learned during the course of this semester will help me through out my career in computer engineering and beyond. Ethics will help me figure out the rights and wrongs of a job while design patterns will help me figure out solutions to problems faster. I am grateful to have learned these concepts as they can prepare me for what lies ahead in my life.
