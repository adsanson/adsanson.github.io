<p>We’ve heard it all before, the Lego story, the story about how a simple building toy got us into learning about engineering. And while I do have a similar story since I too am still a very avid fan of Legos, I won’t be sharing that one. The story I’m going for is one that has allowed me to not only be a reason to learn about computer engineering, but has also allowed me to make freinds during covid, a time when meeting someone was risking the lives of others around you as well as yourself.</p>

<p>During the later years of high school, I slowly started getting into pc gaming due to having been growing tired of gaming on the same console for the last 4 years. Immediatly, I found it refreshing being able to acess a bigger variety of games but there was a problem, I had a typical work laptop and I had little to no money to be able to get a gaming pc at the time. But this didn’t stop my interest in computers to grow, eventaully ending up in the major I am currently studying, computer engineering.</p>

<p>During my time in isolation due to covid, I would start to receive stimulus checks in the mail. And while I did use some of it for food and other living necessities, it also gave me the opportunity to finally do something I always wanted to do, build a PC. Within a month, I was able to gathered all the necessary pc parts to start my build. And while it was no cake walk, it was very fun to do, both hardware and software wise. With this new pc, I was finally able to run games and programs I couldn’t before with my laptop.</p>

<p>A year later, I was well into my online classes, ever more so thanks to my pc. I had also picked up gaming even more now that I had met a group of people that also got into pc gaming due to covid. At first we were a bit awkward with each other since having online friends was a new thing for most of us. Fast foward to now, we are all now very close freinds going as far as having offline meet ups whenever some of us are in the same state as well as being able to talk about problems we have in our lives.</p>

<p>I would have never imagined my life now had I not got in computers due my time in high school. It’s become a big part of my life now and hopefully the future. I can’t wait to start working with them even more once I find a job I’m passionate for in this field.</p>
