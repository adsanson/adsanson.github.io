<p>The first time I started coding, I was very confused on what to do. During my time in EE160, I was given access to PuTTY for coding projects. It was a very difficult to use due to limitations such as having to extract project files using additional program as well as having to connect to UH Manoa’s VPN in order to access our files at home. But with the introduction of Intellij, the process of pushing repositories as well as editing code has been easier.</p>

<p>So far, using ESLint with Intellij for coding has been a lifesaver and very interesting to say the least. Having to make sure that I get the green checkmark helps since it lets me know if there’s any errors or warnings in my code. Adding files has also been easier than before with Intellij, having no need to use an additional program to do so. And the ability to push repositories via GitHub desktop has also allowed me to spend more time coding compared to the days of using PuTTY.</p>

<p>Overall, the use of Intellij and ESLint has increased my productivity significantly. Having the ability to do most actions with a single button press as well as having the program check for errors for me and recommending me ways to fix those errors removes some stress while working. And while I am still a bit confused sometimes when it comes to coding, I am at a much less stressful environment when compared top before with PuTTY.</p>
