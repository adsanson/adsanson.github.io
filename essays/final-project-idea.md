Project: Notes Share

Overview

-The problem: One of the main problems most student have is missing class. This is either due to reasons such as waking up at the wrong time, lack of initiative to go to class, or having trouble finding parking on campus. 

-The solution: Notes Share is a directory where UH Manoa student can share notes or any class related material with each other. UH Manoa students can add in filters such as semester, class name, and quality rating in order to browse a library of notes from other students.

Approach
-To use Notes Share, you must first login or setup a profile. Next, hover over to the search bar and input filters such as class name and semester. This will then show a list of shared notes from other students rated based on quality. Admins are there to watch in case of actions such as asking or giving items with monetary value for notes as well as to make sure the notes aren't things such as anwsers to upcoming tests and such.
